# GigForMe

3rd Year BIS Java Project (Grade - 81%)

A website that allows users to vote for acts that will play at a festival. Uses a Postgresql database. Deployed to Heroku at https://gigforme.herokuapp.com/

(This was previously deployed on a tomcat server on an AWS EC2 virtual machine. I moved it to Heroku as AWS was getting expensive).
